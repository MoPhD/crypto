An implementation of the Caeser Cipher in Python 
1.	It should take command line arguments to --encrypt or --decrypt (use argparse)
2.	It should from command line: python <yourscript.py> [args]
3.	I should be able to run it with Python 3.x to encrypt and decrypt a string from the command line.
An implementation of a hash calculator using MD5 or SHA256 in Python that can simulate a hash collision
1.	It takes command line arguments to use either --md5 or --sha256.
2.	It takes a command line argument that accepts any string of characters or letters
3.	script calculates the hash of the string as given on the command line
4.	script then randomize the input until the randoming functionality generates a hash collision. 
5.	script outputs:
1.	The original input and its hash
2.	The collision hash 
3.	The amount of time it took to find a collision
4.	The number of randomizations of the input that occurred until a collision resulted
